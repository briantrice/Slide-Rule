# Slide-Rule

This program lets you generate complete slide rule patterns

To run the program, you will need:
PIL, and an installation of two fonts: cmuntt.ttf and cmunit.ttf (part of the infamous LaTeX fonts)
which can be found here: https://www.freebestfonts.com/computer-modern-font

The program will prompt which mode you would like to run:

- 'render': Prints a rendering of the full size scales in their correct positions
- 'diagnostic': Prints a rendering containing each available scale arranged in rows
- 'stickerprint': Prints an image which can be scalled to 677.33 ppi in Gimp and then Print+Cut in Silhouette Studio

The produced images are also saved. if you have have trouble finding them, look in the location where your program is (that seemed to work for me)

'render' and 'diagnostic' modes takes around 15 seconds to run, but the 'stickerprint mode' usually takes 1-2 minutes to run so be patient. If you run across issues, comment on instructables or here and I will attempt to explain myself :)

The excel file attached can help convert between pixels, inches, and millimeters when the slide rule is being built out of physical material 

Enjoy!
