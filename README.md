"Laser Cut" file generates png images of the frame alone (Scale Cutting Pattern) and the frame with the scales fully printed inside (Scale Etching Pattern). Additionally, it generates a Diagnostic Print of all the scales alone. Internally, the program can be modified to print pink lines indicating where the metal pieces would go (just un-comment the metalcutoffs() in the rendering section) and you may select whether to render, run diagnostic, or both.
